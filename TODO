Things to do...

*) The documentation is poor, it doesn't mention all of the things which
are supported and the things which are mentioned are not fully described.

*) 'make test' should do more testing.

*) clean up the repository (eg *.exe)

*) the tool should be more "quiet" - not print the stuff it does
currently by default

*) Check number of tags bits we can use properly.  See
dev/Tree/checkLowBits.c

*) Perhaps have some way of switching off type checking and putting in
casts to avoid gcc warning about code which looks dodgey from the type
perspective but it actually ok because its generated by other code (eg,
the Pawns compiler:).


Longer term things:

1) Polymorphic types (we have a design worked out...).

2) Write a paper about the system.
