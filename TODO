There are a few problems with the initial commit to be sorted out.  For starters:

1) 'make test' doesn't have the appropriate dependencies or re-make the appropriate .h file, etc.

2) The documentation is incomplete - it doesn't mention all of the things which are supported and
the things which are mentioned are not fully described.

3) 'make install' copies the executable to $(HOME)/bin; at least the documentation in INSTALL
should be fixed.

4) 'make' results in some gcc warnings: the C code should be cleaned up to avoid them.#Done


Other simple things:

1) Rather than spit out calls to malloc and free it should be easy to use GC_malloc etc.  Best use
ADTPP_MALLOC and ADTPP_FREE and prefix the .h file with
#ifndef ADTPP_MALLOC
#define ADTPP_MALLOC(s) malloc(s)
#endif
(and same for free)

2) Perhaps some way of switching off type checking and putting in casts to avoid gcc warning about
code which looks dodgey from the type perspective but it actually ok because its generated by other code
(eg, the Pawns compiler:).

3) Perhaps 'make dist' should 1nclude the documentation and/or produce a gzipped tar file rather than a zip file.#Done

4) Add a version number.#Done


Longer term things:

1) Polymorphic types (we have a design worked out...).

2) Write a paper about the system.
