Note structure of insertion code is a bit different (our Haskell version
gives more concise code I think).  tree234.m is used by set_tree234.m -
not sure how much that is used (check with zs).  Could try specialising
leaves in the Mercury code and compare performance etc.

:- pragma type_spec(Pred, Subst).
suggests polymorphic code be specialised.  With our suggestion for C we
have to do this for each instance used, and we need to provide separate names
- its not just an optional hint with new names hidden inside the compiler.
