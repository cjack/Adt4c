Support for algebraic data types in C via macros (mostly) with minimal
runtime overhead, compact data repersentation (tagged pointers) and
type+other errors checked by built in checking done by C compiler (ie,
we avoid implementing a parser for extende C + our own type checker etc,
so the design is somewhat constrained).
